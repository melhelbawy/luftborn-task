# luftborn-task
This project is just like a task for hiring opportunity at https://www.luftborn.com/ 

## Test objectives:

In general, we want to have at least some code in the following three languages:
● C#
● JavaScript (TypeScript)
● CSS (SCSS)
Using any external library is allowed, the same goes for old code in your repository.
Utilizing external libraries does have to be utilized for a good reason though.

## Tasks

1. Create an empty ASP.NET core application
2. Basic CRUD operations:
Add basic CRUD operations to the application.
3. SSO (Single Sign on) Optional task:
Implement SSO in the application with
any external identity provider of your
choice, (ADFS is recommended).

## Focuspoints

● Scalability: Our solution needs to be maintainable and scalable.
● Readability: write code with meaningful function and variable names
● Extract your code to classes where
a class or a function only have one specific purpose
● Only write comments, if code is not self-explanatory (which it should be for the most part)
● Try to write your own code.
● Importing libraries has to be for a good reason.

## Technologies
Web: ASP.NET Core
Database: SQL Server.
Frontend: Angular.
